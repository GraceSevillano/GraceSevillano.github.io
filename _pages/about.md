I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Signal and Image Processing with a specialization in Computer Vision and Robotics (VIBOT) from the <a href="https://www.u-bourgogne.fr/" target="_blank">University of Burgundy</a>, France. My Master's thesis internship, completed on September 30, 2024, at the <a href="https://unit.aist.go.jp/jrl-22022" target="_blank">CNRS-AIST JRL (Joint Robotics Laboratory), IRL3218</a> in Tsukuba, Japan, was conducted under the supervision of <a href="https://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~g-caron/fr/" target="_blank">Dr. Guillaume Caron</a> and <a href="https://nevrez.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Nevrez Imamoglu</a>. My thesis, titled "Combined Dual-Fisheye and Color-Depth Vision for Real-Time Full-Scale Spherical Image Depth Imaging," will soon be published in an academic journal, contributing innovative insights into 3D vision and depth perception for robotics.

I earned my B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering from the National University of Engineering (UNI), Peru. My professional experience includes research and industry roles as a Data Intelligence Specialist and Computer Vision Engineer, with a focus on Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and 3D vision applied to robotics. In 2022, I was awarded the "Alberto Benavides de la Quintana - French Embassy 2022" graduate scholarship by Patronato UNI and the French Embassy, which supported my education and research journey in these fields.
