I am currently a Master's student in Signal and Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotics (VIBOT), with a B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering from the National University of Engineering (UNI), Peru, obtained in 2018. Over the years, I have accumulated valuable experience, including roles such as a Research Assistant at the Signal and Image Processing Lab at INICTEL-UNI and a Data Intelligence Specialist in the private mining sector. In 2022, I was awarded the "Alberto Benavides de la Quintana - French Embassy 2022" graduate scholarship by the Patronato UNI and the French Embassy, which has allowed me to further my studies and research.

I am currently conducting my Master's thesis at the [CNRS-AIST JRL (Joint Robotics Laboratory), IRL3218](https://unit.aist.go.jp/jrl-22022/en/){:target="\_blank"} in Tsukuba, Japan. My research focuses on combining dual-fisheye and color-depth vision for real-time, full-scale spherical image depth imaging, encompassing key areas such as 3D vision and computer vision. This work not only reflects my passion for engineering and innovation but also underscores my commitment to advancing technologies that can have a significant impact in robotics and computer vision.
