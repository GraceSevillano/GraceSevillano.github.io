I recently earned a <b>Master’s degree in Signal and Image Processing</b>, specializing in <b>Computer Vision & Robotics</b> (VIBOT), from the <a href="https://www.u-bourgogne.fr/" target="_blank">University of Burgundy</a>, France. My <b>Master’s thesis internship</b> was conducted at the <a href="https://unit.aist.go.jp/jrl-22022" target="_blank">CNRS-AIST JRL (Joint Robotics Laboratory), IRL3218</a> in Tsukuba, Japan, under the supervision of <a href="https://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~g-caron/fr/" target="_blank">Dr. Guillaume Caron</a> and <a href="https://nevrez.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Nevrez Imamoglu</a>.  

My research during this internship forms the basis of a journal article titled <i>"Hybrid Appearance-Depth 360-Degree Simultaneous Localization and Mapping,”</i> which is currently under review in <b>IEEE Transactions on Robotics</b>.  

I hold a <b>B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering</b> from the <a href="https://www.uni.edu.pe/" target="_blank">National University of Engineering (UNI)</a>, Peru. My background combines <b>computer vision, robotics, artificial intelligence, and data science</b>. My professional experience spans both <b>research and industry</b>, having worked as a <b>Data Intelligence Specialist</b> and <b>Computer Vision Engineer</b>, where I applied <b>deep learning, SLAM, and 3D vision techniques</b> to solve complex robotics and AI challenges.  

In <b>2022</b>, I was awarded the prestigious <b>"Alberto Benavides de la Quintana - French Embassy" graduate scholarship</b> by <a href="https://patronatouni.org.pe/" target="_blank">Patronato UNI</a> and the <a href="https://www.ambafrance.org/" target="_blank">French Embassy</a>, which supported my academic and research journey.  

<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>My research interests include:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>3D Vision & SLAM for robotic perception</li>
  <li>Neural rendering & AI-driven depth estimation</li>
  <li>Machine learning & deep learning for robotics applications</li>
</ul>
