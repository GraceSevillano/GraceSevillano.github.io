I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Signal and Image Processing with a specialization in Computer Vision and Robotics (VIBOT) at the [University of Burgundy](https://www.u-bourgogne.fr/), France.  I earned my B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering from the National University of Engineering (UNI), Peru. My professional background is diverse, including a role as a Research Assistant at INICTEL-UNI's Signal and Image Processing Lab and significant experience as a Data Intelligence Specialist and Computer Vision Engineer in the private sector. In 2022, I was honored to receive the "Alberto Benavides de la Quintana - French Embassy 2022" graduate scholarship awarded by the Patronato UNI and the French Embassy, facilitating my continued education and research in this field.

I am currently conducting my Master's thesis at the [CNRS-AIST JRL (Joint Robotics Laboratory), IRL3218](https://unit.aist.go.jp/jrl-22022){:target="\_blank"} in Tsukuba, Japan, under the guidance of my advisors [Dr. Guillaume Caron](https://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~g-caron/fr/) and [Dr. Nevrez Imamoglu](https://nevrez.github.io/). My research focuses on combining dual-fisheye and color-depth vision for real-time, full-scale spherical image depth imaging, encompassing key areas such as 3D vision and computer vision. This work not only reflects my passion for engineering and innovation but also underscores my commitment to advancing technologies that can have a significant impact in robotics and computer vision.
