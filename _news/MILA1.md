Just completed the **Montreal Robotics Summer School 2025** at [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/)! 🇨🇦

    It was an exciting and enriching experience where we explored advanced topics in robot perception, SLAM, sim2real transfer, and deep learning-based control. During the hands-on sessions, we tested our solutions on the **LoCoBot** and the **Unitree Go1** quadruped robot (dog robot 🐶), and also worked with **NVIDIA Isaac Lab** for simulation and deployment.

Grateful for the chance to learn from and collaborate with world-class researchers and robotics enthusiasts. Looking forward to applying these skills in future robotic applications!
