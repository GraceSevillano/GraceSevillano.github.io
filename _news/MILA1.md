summary: One week of hands-on robotics with LoCoBot, Go1, and Isaac Lab at Mila!
---

It was an exciting and enriching experience where we explored advanced topics in robot perception, SLAM, sim2real transfer, and deep learning-based control. During the hands-on sessions, we tested our solutions on the **LoCoBot** and the **Unitree Go1** quadruped robot, and also worked with **NVIDIA Isaac Lab** for simulation and deployment.
