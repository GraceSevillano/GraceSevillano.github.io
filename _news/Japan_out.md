Thrilled to have completed my **Master's Thesis Internship** at CNRS-AIST JRL (Joint Robotics Laboratory) in Japan on September 30, 2024. This experience has been invaluable in advancing my research in spherical depth imaging and robotics. Excitingly, the results of this work will soon be submitted to a journal, highlighting our innovative contributions to real-time depth imaging for robotic applications.
