Proud to share that I’ve been **selected among 25 participants worldwide** to join the **Montreal Robotics Summer School 2025** at [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/)! Looking forward to exploring advanced topics in robot perception, SLAM, sim2real transfer, and deep learning-based control for quadruped and humanoid robots this August.
